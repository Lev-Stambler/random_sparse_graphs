\section{Non-Consistent Labeled and Traversing an Encrypted Graph}
Though we require the random oracle model for GRO when we require a consistent
embedding of a graph $\graph$, we can define a weaker notion of GRO where
we label the vertices of $\graph$ in a non-consistent manner. I.e.\ one vertex may be labeled
differently depending on prior queries to the neighbor function. Indeed, we can
think of this setting as traversing an encrypted graph where each vertex has a random encryption.
