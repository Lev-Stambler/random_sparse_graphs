\section{DAG Label Obfuscation from Additive Overhead iO}
\subsection{DAG Randomized Traversal}
Say that we have a sparse, potentially exponentially sized, graph $\graph = (\verts, \edges)$ with polynomial depth $D$,
and forall $v \in \verts, \deg(v) \leq d$. Moreover, for simplicity,
assume that for all $v$, 
$$
\deg^{-1}(v) = \big|\set{u \in V \mid \exists j \in [d], \Gamma(u)_j = v}\big| \leq d.
$$
In words, there are at most $d$ edges into a vertex. As a note, our construction just requires
that $\deg^{-1}(\cdot) = O(1)$ but for the sake of simplicity we fix $\deg^{-1}(\cdot) \leq d$.

We also require that $\graph$ is equipped with a neighbor function, $\Gamma$, which can be computed in polynomial time.
% (TODO: padding).
We define a randomized and keyed labelling function $\phi: \binSet^\lambda \times \verts \rightarrow \binSet^{\poly(\lambda)}$ 
such that given, $\phi(K, v_0)$ for root $v_0$, a PPT adversary which runs in time at most $T(\lambda)$, $\advers$, which does not know a path from $v_0$ to $v$,
% TODO: defn extractor??
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:guessPhi}
	\Pr[\advers(\mathcal{O}(\circNeigb), v_0, v, \labelFunc(K, v_0)) = \labelFunc(K, v)] \leq \epsilon
\end{equation}
for function $\circNeigb$ where $\circNeigb(\labelFunc(K, u)) = \labelFunc(K, \Gamma(u)_1), \dots, \labelFunc(K, \Gamma(u)_d)$ and the circuit is padded to size $\compDepth$.
if $\Gamma(u) \neq \emptyset$ and otherwise $\Gamma(u)$ returns a $\bot$ string.
We fix the adversary's advantage to $\epsilon < \poly(\lambda)$ and runtime to $T(\lambda) \leq \poly(\lambda, \frac{1}{\eps})$
as we will need to show
that a set of a potentially exponential number of games \emph{does not have exponential security loss}
nor or \emph{reduce down to security against an exponentially strong adversary}.

\subsection{Using Constant Overhead iO}
\label{def:constOverheadParam}

We let $\paramPad$ blah blah blah

\subsection{Instantiation}
We define 
$
	\labelFunc(K, v) = F(K, v)
$ for $K \randomGet \set{0, 1}^\lambda$, and we can now define $\circNeigb$:
\begin{algorithm}[H]
	\caption{
		The circuit for the neighbor function, $\circNeigb$ padded out to size $\compDepth$.
	}
	\begin{algorithmic}[1]
		\Function{$\circNeigb$}{$X, v$}
			\If{$f(X) \neq f(F(K, v))$}
				\State \Return $\bot$
			\EndIf
		 	\If{$\Gamma(v) = \emptyset$}
				\State \Return $\bot$
			\EndIf
			\State $u_1, \dots u_d = \Gamma(v)$
			\State \Return $F(K, u_1), F(K, u_2), \dots, F(K, u_d)$
		\EndFunction
	\end{algorithmic}
	\label{alg:neighb}
\end{algorithm}

% TODO: more concrete somewhere with overhead
We are going to show that \cref{eq:guessPhi} for $\compDepth = O(D \cdot \iOOverHead)$ where $\iOOverHead$ is the additive overhead of indistinguishable obfuscation.
We will do this by first showing that the non-existence of an extractor to find a path from $v_0$ to $v$ implies that $\advers$
necessarily does not know $\phi(K, c)$ for a $c \in C_V \subset V$ where the vertices in $C_V$ border 
a graph cut which separates $v_0$ and $v$. Note that the base case holds for all $S \geq \poly(\lambda)$. 

Then, we inductively build up a series of games to show that
$\advers$ cannot learn \emph{any} $\phi(K, v)$ for $v \in V_1$ where $V_1$ are the vertices on the side of the cut containing $v$.
At each inductive step, we restrict the security game to hold for $S \geq O(\inductiveInd \cdot \text{overhead})$ where $\inductiveInd$ is the number of calls to induction.
% TODO: note no more than D inductive calls

% TODO: define P way above
\begin{lemma}[Base Case Game]
	\label{lemma:cutBaseCase}
	Assuming that there is no extractor $E$ such that $\Pr[E(\Gamma, v_0, v) = P] \geq \frac{1}{p(\lambda)}$
	where $P \in \pathSet$, then for any PPT $\advers$, there exists some graph cut 
	$C_E \subset E$ which separates $v_0$ and $v$ and a set $C_V$ such that
	\begin{equation}
		\label{eq:cutLabel}
		\Pr[\advers(\obfFN(\circNeigb), v_0, v, \phi(K, v_0)) \in \phi(K, C_V)] < \eps
	\end{equation}
		for any $\compDepth \geq \poly(\lambda)$.
		We define $C_V \subset V$ to be
	\begin{equation*}
		% TODO: there is a graph theoretic name for this.
		\set{ u \mid (w, u) \in C_E \text{ and } u \text { on the side of } v} \bigcup \set{ w \mid (w, u) \in C_E \text{ and } w \text { on the side of } v}.
	\end{equation*}
	In words, $C_V$ are the vertices just adjacent to the cut and on the same side as $v$.
	\begin{proof}
		We will show that if $\advers$ can break \cref{eq:cutLabel}, then we can construct an extractor,
		$E$, which finds a path from $v_0$ to $v$ with non-negligible probability.

		Assume that for every possible cut, $\advers$ is able to produce a single label in this cut for a vertex $w$.
		Then, we note that there must be at least 1 path from $v_0$ to $w$ and from $w$ to $v$ as otherwise, $w$ would not be in the cut.
		Moreover, we note that $\advers$ must be able to produce a label for all vertices on at least one path
		from $v_0$ to $w$ as otherwise, we can change the cut to include the edges between where
		$\advers$ is able to produce a label and not able to produce a label. Using the same argument,
		we can show that $\advers$ must be able to produce all labels on a path from $w$ to $v$.

		Note that $\advers$ is not given the specific cut $C_E$ but rather $C_E$ is chosen based off of the adversary.
		So, we can build an extractor to do the following:
		% TODO: is this selective security?????
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Create an iO obfuscated circuit with a random key, $K'$, for $\circNeigb$ and create circuit $\obfFN(\circNeigb)$
			as well as $\phi(K', v_0)$
			\item Run $\advers(\obfFN(\circNeigb), v_0, v, \phi(K', v_0))$ to get all labels $\phi(K', v_0), \dots \phi(K', v)$
			for some path from $v_0$ to $v$.
			\item Recreate the path from $v_0$ to $v$ via checking which vertex matches to adjacent labels in the path:
			% TODO: this assumes no cycles!!!
			I.e.\ starting with $\ell = 0$, we can learn the $\ell + 1$ vertex via finding $j \in [d]$ such that
			$\circNeigb(\phi(K', v_\ell), v_\ell)_j \in \set{\phi(K', v_0), \dots, \phi(K', v)}$
			 and then setting $v_{\ell + 1} = \Gamma(v_\ell)_j$.
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{proof}
\end{lemma}

We can look at \cref{lemma:cutBaseCase} as a ``base case'' of sorts. We now inductively build up a series of games
such that $\advers$ cannot find any label in $V_1$ where $V_1$ are the vertices on side of the cut (as defined in \cref{lemma:cutBaseCase})
which contain $v$.

\begin{lemma}[Inductive Game Hypothesis]
	Let $H_\inductiveInd \subset V$ be a ``hard'' set of vertices for the $\inductiveInd$-th step of induction such that $\advers$ cannot, with non-negligible probability, produce 
	$\phi(K, h)$ where $h \in H$. Note that the base case has $H = C_V$. 
	Assuming adaptive security of constrained PRFs, one way functions, and the existence of additive overhead indistinguishable obfuscation,
	we then have
	% TODO: fix O at constant poly
	% TODO: define q
	for any $w \in \Gamma(h)$ and $\compDepth \geq \paramPad(\inductiveInd, \lambda)$ for all $h \in H$, 
	\begin{equation*}
		% TODO: change all to just <
		% TODO: maybe we nee to fix \eps
		\Pr[\advers(\obfFN(\circNeigb), v_0, w, \phi(K, v_0)) = \phi(K, w)] < \eps.
	\end{equation*}
	\begin{proof}
		We are going to use a series of indistinguishable hybrids along with the circuit defined in \ref{alg:neighbHyb1} to show the above
		\begin{itemize}
			\item $\Hyb_0$: In the first hybrid, the following game is played
				\begin{enumerate}
					\item The challenger gives the adversary $w^*$ in plaintext.
					\item $K \gets \binSet^{\lambda'}$ and $\phi(K, v_0) = (F(K, v_0), v_0)$ where $K$ is some fixed secret drawn from a uniform distribution
					\item The challenger generates $\mathcal{O}(\circNeigb)$ and gives the program to $\advers$
					\item $\advers$ outputs guess $g$ and wins if $g = \phi(K, w^*)$ %hmmm... do we give w?
				\end{enumerate}
			
			\item $\Hyb_1$: We replace $\circNeigb$ with $\circNeigb$ as defined in circuit~\ref{alg:neighbHyb1}.
			Fix the constant $z^* = f(F(K, w^*))$
			% and $y^*_1 = f(F(K, \Gamma(w^*)_1)), \dots, y^*_d = f(F(K, \Gamma(w^*)_d))$.
			\item $\Hyb_{2, 1}$
			We replace circuit~\ref{alg:neighbHyb1} with circuit~\ref{alg:neighbHyb2} where we 
			set $Y^* = (1, y)$ such that $\Gamma(y)_1 = w^*$. So then, we have that
			have $F(K, \Gamma(y)_1) = \bot$. Moreover, we set the punctured set, $S$ to $\emptyset$ (i.e.\ we do not puncture the PRF).
			\item $\Hyb_{2, j}$ for $j \in \set{2, \dots, \deg^{-1}(w^*)}$
			We replace $Y^*$ with $Y^* \cup (j, y)$ such that $\Gamma(y)_j = w^*$.
			Note after the last of these hybrids, we have that $F(K, w^*)$ is always set to $\bot$.
			\item $\Hyb_3$: We puncture the PRF at $w^*$ and set $S = \set{w^*}$.
			\item $\Hyb_4$: Set $z^* = f(t)$ where $t$ is chosen at random %TODO: specify field size
		\end{itemize}
		Finally, we can note that if $\Hyb_0 \compInd \Hyb_4$,
		\begin{equation*}
			\Pr[\advers(\circNeigb, v_0, w, \phi(K, v_0)) = \phi(K, w)] 
			\compInd
			\Pr[\advers(\circNeigb^*, v_0, w, \phi(K, v_0)) = \phi(K, w)]
		\end{equation*}
		where $z^*$ in $\circNeigb^*$	is the image on a OWF of a randomly chosen point.
		As we will show in \cref{lemma:hybA}, \cref{lemma:hybB}, and \cref{lemma:hybC},
		an adversaries advantage between games in $\Hyb_0$ and $\Hyb_3$ is at most $\epsilon / 2$.
		Thus, if $\advers$ can produce $\phi(K, v) = (\sigma_v, v)$ with advantage $\epsilon / 2$
		in $\Hyb_3$, then $\advers$
		can find a pre-image for $z^*$ under $f$ with non-negligible probability and thus break the security of a one way function.
		We then have that the advantage of the adversary in $\Hyb_0$ cannot be more than $\epsilon$.
	\end{proof}
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}
	\label{lemma:hybA}
	% TODO: workout
	$\Hyb_0$ and $\Hyb_1$ are distinguishable with advantage at most $\epsilon / 10$.
	\begin{proof}
		Assume towards contradiction that $\eps \in \poly(1/\lambda)$.
		Note that for all inputs $(z, v)$ to $\circNeigb$ as defined in circuit~\ref{alg:neighb} and circuit~\ref{alg:neighbHyb1}
		are equivalent and thus indistinguishable by the definition of indistinguishable obfuscation.
		So, if $\eps \in \poly(\lambda)$, then an adversary cannot distinguish the hybrids with probability more than $\epsilon / 10$.
	\end{proof}
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}
	\label{lemma:hybB}
	Each hybrid from $\Hyb_1$ to $\Hyb_{2, 1}$ and $\Hyb_{2, j - 1}$ to $\Hyb_{2, j}$ for $j \in 2, \dots, \deg^{-1}(w^*)$
	is distinguishable with advantage at most $\epsilon / (10d)$. Thus, $\Hyb_1$ and $\Hyb_{2, \deg^{-1}(w^*)}$ are distinguishable with advantage at most $\epsilon / 10$.
	\begin{proof}
		This proof will be a modification of the proof in \cite{ishai2015public} for the simple case of weak extractible obfuscation.
		The key idea lies on two observations:
		\begin{enumerate}[labelsep=0.1em]
			\item We can go from $\Hyb_{2, j - 1}$ (or $\Hyb_1$) to a ``padded out'' version of $\Hyb_{2, j}$ by obfuscating a program which calls $\circNeigb$ internally and returns $\bot$ for the $j$-th input.
			\item We can go from $\Hyb_{2, j - 1}$ (or $\Hyb_1$) to a padded out version of itself.
			\item If an adversary can produce $\Hyb_{2, j - 1}$ (or $\Hyb_1$) and $\Hyb_{2, j}$ which are of the same size and can distinguish them with advantage at least $\epsilon / 10d$,
			then we can build an adversary, $\adversB$, which can produce a label $\phi(K, h)$ for $h \in H$ in $\Hyb_0/ \Hyb_1$.
		\end{enumerate}

		For simplicity, say that the input size to all of our circuits is $n$. Let $s \in \Z$ such that $s \geq \paramPad(\inductiveInd, \lambda)$.
		Also, let $C_0^s$ be the circuit from the first hybrid and $C_1^s$ the one from the second.

		At a high level, we will show that an adversary can create a ``padded out'' $C_1$ given only $C_0$. Then, 
		if an adversary can distinguish between $C_0^{s'}$ and $C_1^{s'}$ for $s' \geq \paramPad(\inductiveInd + 1, \lambda)$, we can break the inductive hypothesis.

		First, given $C_0^s$, $\advers$ can construct a larger version of $C_1^{s'}$ by obfuscating a program which calls $C_0^s$ internally and returns $\bot$ for the $j$-th input of $w$.
		$\advers$ also then produces $C_0^s$ which is $C^0$ padded out to the size of $C_1^{s'}$.
		% TODO: not v precise
		% TODO: add label
		Note that we define $\paramPad(\inductiveInd + 1, \lambda) - \paramPad(\inductiveInd, \lambda)$ in \cref{def:constOverheadParam} to be
		at least as large as the difference between $C_0^s$ and $C_1^{s'}$.
		% \linebreak

		% Call this larger circuit $C_1'$ with circuit size $\lambda'$.
		% Moreover, $\advers$ can construct a larger version of $C_0$, which we will call $C_0'$, by simply padding it out to the size of $C_1'$.
		% Now, if there exists a distinguishing adversary for this larger game with circuit size $\lambda'$, we can break the inductive hypothesis of the scheme with circuit size $\lambda$.
		Now, assume towards contradiction that there exists an adversary $\advers$ that can distinguish $C_0^{s'}$ and $C_1^{s'}$ with advantage $\epsilon' > \epsilon / 10d$
		in $O(T')$ time with polynomial advantage $\epsilon' > \epsilon / 10d$.
		Let $\circMid_i$ be a circuit such that $\circMid_i(X) = C_0(X)$ if $X_i = 0$ and $\circMid_i(X) = C_1(X)$ if $X_i = 1$.\\
		We can see that $C_0^{s'}$ and $C_1^{s'}$ differ on at most 1 input which we will call $\alpha$. %(which is the appended vertex $y$ to $Y^*$);
		% call this input $\alpha$.
		Then, $\circMid_i = C_0$ if $\alpha_i = 0$ and $\circMid_i = C_1$ if $\alpha_i = 1$.
		So, if we build an adversary $\adversB$ to tell if $\circMid_i = C_0^{s'}$ or $\circMid_i = C_1^{s'}$ with probability $\gamma$,
		we have that $\adversB(C_0^{s'}, C_1^{s'})$ can be used to check if $\alpha_i$ is $0$ or $1$ with probability $\gamma$.
		So then, $\adversB$ can be used to learn $\phi(K, \alpha)$ with probability at least $\gamma^n$.
		We then have that because $\alpha \in H$ and the initial circuit has size $s \geq \paramPad(\inductiveInd, \lambda)$, $\adversB$ can break the inductive hypothesis!\\
		\linebreak
		% 
		% Now, if $\adversB$ can distinguish $C_0^{s'}, C_1^{s'}$, we can create and adversary $\adversD$
		% which can output a label of a vertex in $H$ with probability $\gamma^n$.
		% $\adversD(C_0^{s'}, C_1^{s'})$ proceeds by running $\adversB(\iO(C_0'), \iO(C_1'))$ $n$ times to get the differing input
		% As $C_1$ can be created by an adversary with access to $C_0$, an adversary, $\adversD$, could then
		% produce a label for a vertex in $H$ via simulating calls to $\adversB$.
		% and thus gives our desired contradiction.
		% Moreover, we have that $\advers(C_0)$ (where $C_0 = \circNeigb$) can construct $C_1$ (and thus $\circMid_i$)
		% by obfuscating a program which calls $\circNeigb$ internally and returns $\bot$ for the $j$-th input
		% if the input vertex is $u$ such that $(j, u) \in Y^*$.
		To build $\adversB$ to tell if $\circMid_i = C_0$ or $C_1$ with probability $\gamma^n \geq \epsilon$, we will make oracle calls to $\advers$:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Run $I =\left\lceil 
			\frac{12\left(\ln 2 + \ln n - \ln\left(1 - \eps\right) + \ln 2\right)}{\eps'} \right\rceil$ iterations of the following experiment to estimate advantage $\epsilon'_b$ for $b \in \set{0, 1}$
				\begin{enumerate}
					% TODO: REOBFUSCATE??
					% Urrr we need to have 3 gratings of security parameters
					% Okay we need to keep far more careful track of parameters throughout here
					% Urgie turgies.... re-randomization of iO... learn about zis shsz **deeply**
					\item Sample a random obfuscation of $C_b^{s'}$ via re-randomizing the obfuscating of the existing $C_b^{s'}$
					\item Sample a random obfuscation of $\circMid_i$ via re-obfuscating $\circMid_i$
					\item Have $\advers$ distinguish between $C_b$ and $\circMid$
					\item Output 1 if successful.
				\end{enumerate}
			Note that we can estimate $\epsilon'_b$ as the number of successful runs, which we will denote $\sum_{j \in [I]} S_{i, j}$, divided by $I$.
			\item If $\epsilon'_1 > \epsilon'_0$, then $\circMid = C_0$, otherwise, $\circMid = C_1$.
		\end{enumerate}

		Note that $\adversB$ runs in time $O(T' I)$. So, if we set the upper-bound on the runtime of the adversary in \cref{eq:guessPhi}
		to $O(T' I))$, then $\adversB$ can learn $\phi(K, y)$ with probability $\gamma^n \geq \frac{\epsilon}{10d}$.

		We differ the proof that $I$ is the correct choice of parameters such that
		$\gamma^n \geq \frac{\epsilon}{10d}$ to \cref{appendix:paramHybB}.
		% TODO: URRRR with \eps/10d???...

\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}
	The game in $\Hyb_{2, \deg^{-1}(w^*)}$ is indistinguishable from $\Hyb_3$ with probability
	at most $\eps/10$.
	\begin{proof}
		As with \cref{lemma:hybA}, 
		the indistinguishably follows directly from the definition of indistinguishable obfuscation.
	\end{proof}
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}
	\label{lemma:hybC}
	% TODO: assuming this then that
	The game in $\Hyb_{3}$ is indistinguishable from $\Hyb_4$.
	\begin{proof}
		Assume towards contradiction that $\eps \in \poly(1/\lambda)$.
		We now show that if the advantage of $\advers$ is greater than $\eps/10$, then we can
		create a reduction, $\adversB$, which can break the security of the PRF at the punctured point.
		$\adversB$ first chooses a message $w^*$ and submits this to the constrained PRF challenger and gets back the punctured PRF key
		$K(\set{w^*})$ and challenge $a$. $\adversB$ then runs the experiment in $\Hyb_{2, \deg^{-1}(w^*)}$
		except that $z^* = f(a)$. If $a$ is the output of the PRF, then we are in $\Hyb_{2, \deg^{-1}(w^*)}$,
		if $a$ is the output of a random function, then we are in $\Hyb_3$.
